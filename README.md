This is a small project that is a simple image viewer with a nice interface..

The project is written in the **python** programming language and is based on the **Qt** framework and the **PySide6** wrapper. In addition, the unfinished new version has a custom window frame. (to implement it, I took this [project](https://github.com/re7gog/CustomWindow))

That's all .. the project will not be updated in any way .. you can safely use it for your own purposes .. sorry..
